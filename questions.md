#Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

I learned about using express for routing and middleware in my web servers.

#Describe Middleware?

Middleware is just a function that is called before your route handler runs. It has three arguments: request, response, and next.

#Describe a Resource?

A resource is anything on the server. It could be a static file, a database entry, etc.

#What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

The API is often expected to return a status code. The universal code for "ok" is 200.

#How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

We can partition our application into sub-applications with the help of express router.
